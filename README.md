This simple application (and future gem) runs from the command line allows you to check urls in a CSV to determine success rate. It can also replace 'http' with 'https' urls in CSVs.

In order to run, simply run the url_reports_for_csv file in the /bin folder. By default, it will clean and build a report on the tactic.csv in the folder, but you can provide an single string argument with the relative path to your csv and it will clean/report on that csv.

Please bundle install before you run to download proper versions of each dependency.
